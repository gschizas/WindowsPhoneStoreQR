# WindowsPhoneStoreQR
Windows Phone Store QR Extension

When browsing the Windows Phone App Store, this extension adds a QR code of the application link in the page, that you can scan with Bing Vision and take your phone directly to the Store app, on the page for the application.

There is other extensions that do the same thing, but this one: 

* Works only on windowsphone.com (so it won't interfere in your normal browsing
* It works with https as well
* It calculates the QR code locally, without sending any data to any external server.
